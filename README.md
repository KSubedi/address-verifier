# address-verifier
This tool will format any address to the closest right representation of it and also give more details about the address.

It is built using Vue.js (via CDN) and is made to be as simple as possible. It uses Google's [GeoCode API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro).

You can use the online hosted version at [https://address.wp.gy](https://address.wp.gy/)
